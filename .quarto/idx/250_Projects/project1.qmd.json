The state with the most names was California with 66 babies that shared my name. This accounts for nearly 18% of the national total. I was born in Arizona, which had 8 babies born in 1999 named Maia, making it more meaninful to me to see my name reflected in the data from my birth year and state. Looking at the chart I created, the data suggests that while Maia wasn't a top national name, it has been steadily adopted across a variety of coast, particularly in the coasts and in urbanized regions. The black line in the chart represents the underlying trend over time, a steady increase in popularity starting around the late 1990s and continuing past 2010. I expect that it will remain at this steady rate unless an outside source influences our society (Ex: popculture, movies, books, etc.).\n\n```{python}\n\n#Package that turns data from python lists, dictionaries, pandas df to nicely formatted tables. clean, printable string\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n#Naming my variable and assigning my year of birth so that I can look up the data within this year\nmy_name = \"Maia\"\nbirth_year = 1999\n\n#The df is shorthand for DataFrame, with this specific application here, it allows me to create a new variable to store the filtered DataFrame, which only contains rows for the name\"Maia\"\n\n#The .copy() creates a separate copy of the filtered DataFrame to avoid warnings when modifying it later.\nmy_name_df = df[df['name'] == my_name].copy()\n\n#The \"my_name_df...th_year\" creates a Boolean filter: Returns TRUE for rows where the year is 1999, and FALSE otherwise.\nbirth_year_count = my_name_df[my_name_df['year'] == birth_year]\n\n#Prints the filtered DataFrame to show how many babies named \"Maia\" were born in 1999, across all U.S. states.\nprint(birth_year_count)\n\n#Creates a new DF named maia_df that includes only the rows where the baby name is \"Maia\".
