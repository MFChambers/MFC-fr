Your example should display the \"NaN\" for at least one missing value.__  \n\nBy replacing empty string and \"999\" with NaN.

Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.   \n\nThe proportion I used to identify the airport with worst delays is the proportion of delayed flights. This is crucial for identifying airports where delays happen often. A small airport would have fewere total minutes of delay but a very high proportion of late departures, which could still make it the \"worst\" from a passenger's perspective. I also used the average delay time in hours so that we can determine how severe the delays are, on average, to get an accurate depiction of airports when delays occur. A hgigher proportion of delays may indicate frequency, average delay time indicaes the intensity.\n\n```{python}\n## QUESTION|TASK 2\n\n# Create delay indicator and helper column for average delay\ndf_clean['is_delayed'] = df_clean['minutes_delayed_total'].fillna(0) > 0\ndf_clean['delay_minutes_filled'] = df_clean['minutes_delayed_total'].fillna(0)\n\n# Summary by airport\nsummary = (\n    df_clean.groupby('airport_code')\n    .agg(\n        total_flights=('num_of_flights_total', 'sum'),\n        delayed_flights=('is_delayed', 'sum'),\n        avg_delay_hr=('delay_minutes_filled', lambda x: x.mean() / 60)\n    )\n    .reset_index()\n)\n\nsummary['prop_delayed'] = summary['delayed_flights'] / summary['total_flights']\nsummary = summary.sort_values(by='prop_delayed', ascending=False)\n\n# Optional: Display the summary table\nprint(summary.head())\n\n\n\n```\n\nBased on the findings, the highest proportion of delayed flights was IAD (Washington Dulles) with the worst delays, even though its a smaller airport. Passengers that fly through IAD are more likely to experience delays. If we take into account the average delay duratio, ORD (Chicago O'Hare) would be the worst airport. Suggesting that even though delays are less likely and less frequent than IAD, they are significantly longer when they do happen. IAD is the worst in frequency and ORD is the worst in severity. \n\n## QUESTION|TASK 3\n\n__What is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length?__\n\nTo identify the best month to fly, I analyzed average delay per flight by month. I chose this metric because it accounts for both the frequency and intensity of delays, rather than just whether any delay occurred. By calculating the total minutes of delay divided by the total number of flights for each airport-month, then averaging these across all airports, we get a fair comparison of punctuality month by month.\n\n```{python}\n# Filter and clean the data\ndf_month = df_clean.copy()\n\n# Drop rows missing month or flights\ndf_month = df_month.dropna(subset=['month', 'num_of_flights_total'])\n\n# Map month names to numbers\nmonth_name_to_num = {\n    'January': 1, 'February': 2, 'March': 3, 'April': 4,\n    'May': 5, 'June': 6, 'July': 7, 'August': 8,\n    'September': 9, 'October': 10, 'November': 11, 'December': 12\n}\ndf_month['month_num'] = df_month['month'].map(month_name_to_num)\n\n# Fix missing delay values so months like February aren’t dropped\ndf_month['minutes_delayed_total'] = pd.to_numeric(df_month['minutes_delayed_total'], errors='coerce').fillna(0)\n\n# Drop if num_of_flights_total is 0\ndf_month = df_month[df_month['num_of_flights_total'] > 0]\n\n# Calculate average delay per flight\ndf_month['avg_delay_per_flight_hr'] = df_month['minutes_delayed_total'] / df_month['num_of_flights_total'] / 60\n\n# Group by month\nmonth_summary = (\n    df_month.groupby(['month', 'month_num'], as_index=False)\n    .agg(avg_delay_hr=('avg_delay_per_flight_hr', 'mean'))\n    .sort_values('month_num')\n)\n\n# Check which months are actually present\nprint(month_summary['month'])\n\n# Plot\nggplot(month_summary, aes(x='month', y='avg_delay_hr')) + \\\n    geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='#87CEEB') + \\\n    labs(title='Average Delay per Flight by Month (Hours)',\n         x='Month', y='Average Delay (Hours)') + \\\n    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))\n\n```\n\n```{python}\nprint(df_clean[df_clean['month'] == 'February'])\n```\n\nThe chart displays the average delay per flight by month. Based on the data, September has the lowest average delays, making it the best month to travel if your goal is to avoid flight delays.\n\nThis metric reflects both the frequency and intensity of delays by dividing total delay minutes by total flights per month.\n\nNote: February does not appear in the dataset, likely due to missing or incomplete data for that month.\n\n## QUESTION|TASK 4\n\nAccording to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories.\n\nThis section combines delays from three sources: 100% of flights delayed due to severe weather, 30% of delays from late-arriving aircraft, and a month-based proportion of NAS delays (40% from April to August, 65% otherwise). This provides a more complete picture of how both severe and mild weather conditions contribute to flight delays. The data shows that ORD (Chicago O’Hare) experiences the highest total number of weather-related delays (4,502 flights), suggesting it is especially vulnerable to both direct and indirect weather impacts. ATL (Atlanta) also has a substantial number of delays (~3,769), driven largely by NAS-related disruptions. In contrast, airports like IAD (Washington Dulles) and SAN (San Diego) show lower weather-related delay totals, indicating they are either less exposed to disruptive weather or more resilient in handling its effects.

Carrier delays, which typically stem from airline operational issues, are also notable at 3.8%. In contrast, security delays are extremely rare, impacting less than 0.1% of total flights.
